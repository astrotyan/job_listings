The cloud market is still growing at a rapid rate as companies are still in the relatively early stages of moving their workloads to public cloud vendors like Microsoft, Amazon and Google.

In November, a Goldman Sachs report stated that AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud made up 56% of the total cloud market, with that projected to grow to 84% this year. The report shows AWS far, far in the lead with 47% of the market projected for this year, with Azure and Google trailing at 22% and 8% market share, respectively.
